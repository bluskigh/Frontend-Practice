This repo is to show practice work that I am doing when not performing any
backend programming during my day to day business. All credit could be found
in each folder under the file "credit.*" which contains a material to the
original idea, that I used to recreate the websites.

I am purely recreating the websites for practice purposes and not commerical
purposes. I do not in any way shape or form gain Incentive off of others work.
